- Write polyfill for Filter, Reduce, Promise
- DOM Traversal, Manipulation & Creating Elements
- core principles: (JS fundamentals)
- Functions are first-class citizens in JavaScript
- Objects
- Arrays (e.g. [1, 2].reduce((sum, summand) => sum + summand, 0))
- Prototypical Inheritance -> ES6 Class
- Callbacks and Promises
A callback function is called after a given task. It allows other code to be run in the meantime and prevents any blocking
- Regular Expressions
- Error handling (promise.then(...).catch(...), try { } catch(e) { })
- JavaScript ES6 and beyond
- Hoisting, Memoization
- Declarative vs imperative programming
- Functional vs object-oriented programming
- Inheritance vs composition  
- Inheritance types- Single, Multi-level, Multiple
- composition types- object, function, class
- Functions - Factory , Generator, pure and Non-pure
- objects
- hashmap
- shallow and deep copy
- polyfills
- recursive problems - flatten object
- How Event loop works - how heap works  -> event loop handles the recursion, not the call stack
The Event Loop processes simple requests (non-blocking operations), such as I/O Polling, and returns the responses to the corresponding clients
A single thread from the Thread Pool is assigned to a single complex request. This thread is responsible for completing a particular blocking request by accessing external resources, such as computation, database, file system, etc.

Once the task is carried out completely, the response is sent to the Event Loop that sends that response back to the client.

Event loops handle asynchronous callbacks in Node.js. It is the foundation of the non-blocking input/output in Node.js, making it one of the most important environmental features.
