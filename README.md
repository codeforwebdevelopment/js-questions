find sum of all numbers-
let obj = {e:2,
           r:3,
           et:'2',
            aet:{as: '2',

        </ul>
        <ul>
        <li>world</li>
        </ul>

Q.1.
Consider the two functions below. Will they both return the same thing? Why or why not?
function foo1()
{
  return {
      bar: "hello"
  };
}

function foo2()
{
  return
  {
      bar: "hello"
  };
}

Q.2
In what order will the numbers 1-4 be logged to the console when the code below is executed? Why?
(function() {
    console.log(1); 
    setTimeout(function(){console.log(2)}, 1000); 
    setTimeout(function(){console.log(3)}, 0); 
    console.log(4);
})();

Q.3
Write a sum method which will work properly when invoked using either syntax below.
console.log(sum(2,3));   // Outputs 5
console.log(sum(2)(3));  // Outputs 5

Q.4
What will the code below output to the console and why?
var arr1 = "john".split('');
var arr2 = arr1.reverse();
var arr3 = "jones".split('');
arr2.push(arr3);
console.log("array 1: length=" + arr1.length + " last=" + arr1.slice(-1));
console.log("array 2: length=" + arr2.length + " last=" + arr2.slice(-1));

Q.5
What is the output of the following code?
var length = 10;
function fn() {
	console.log(this.length);
}

var obj = {
  length: 5,
  method: function(fn) {
    fn();
    arguments[0]();
  }
};

obj.method(fn, 1);

Q.6
What would following code return?
console.log(typeof typeof 1);

Q.8
duplicate([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); // [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5]

Q.7 How to check if an object is an array or not? Provide some code

Q.9
write a http service method where i can call N number of requestes with the same function using AXIOS (method GET)
Need a textarea box with a random text
when i clicked on button need to copy of that text in side the text area and paste it out in another div
if i changed the text in text area and again if i clicked on button need to update the text in side div

    function sum(a, b, c) {
        if (!isNaN(a) || !isNaN(b) || !isNaN(c)) {
            throw('Not a number')
        }else{
        return a+b+c
        }
        }
        sum(12,"12","14");

 core principles: (JS fundamentals)
Functions are first-class citizens in JavaScript
bind(), apply(), and call()
Scopes and Closures
this
Objects (e.g. Object.keys(myObj).map(key => myMap[key]))
Arrays (e.g. [1, 2].reduce((sum, summand) => sum + summand, 0))
Prototypical Inheritance -> ES6 Class
Callbacks and Promises
Event Loop
Event Bubbling
Regular Expressions
Error handling (promise.then(...).catch(...), try { } catch(e) { })
JavaScript ES6 and beyond
Hoisting, Memoization
Declarative vs imperative programming
Functional vs object-oriented programming
